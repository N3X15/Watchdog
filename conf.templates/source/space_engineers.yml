  This YAML configuration file supports Jinja2 templating with Salt extensions.  This, obviously, is a comment.

  Anything in {% %} are a command to Jinja2. {{ ... }} render the specified variable. {{ blah|yaml_encode }} runs the variable blah through yaml_encode().

  You don't have to use Jinja2, but it makes things a little simpler.

  VARIABLES PASSED:
    home_dir: Whatever ~ is.  Usually /home/username on Linux, C:\Users\username on Windows.
    script_dir: Wherever Watchdog.py was run from.
