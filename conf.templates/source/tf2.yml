{#
  This YAML configuration file supports Jinja2 templating with Salt extensions.  This, obviously, is a comment.
  
  Anything in {% %} are a command to Jinja2. {{ ... }} render the specified variable. {{ blah|yaml_encode }} runs the variable blah through yaml_encode().
  
  You don't have to use Jinja2, but it makes things a little simpler.
